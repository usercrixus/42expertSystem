# Bonus: OR and XOR in Conclusions Tests when result ambiguous

# Test 1: OR in conclusion
A => B | C
# Expected: B = ambiguous, C = ambiguous

# Test 2: XOR in conclusion
D => E ^ F
# Expected: E = ambiguous, F = ambiguous

# Test 3: OR in conclusion used by another rule
G => H | I
H => J
# Expected: H and I ambiguous, J becomes ambiguous
