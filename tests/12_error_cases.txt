# Error Cases Test - Contradictions and Negation Conflicts

# Test 1: Simple contradiction without forcing
B => !B
# Expected: B = false

# Test 2: Contradiction through chain with initial set
E => F
F => !E
# Expected: E = true (input), F = true, contradiction

# Test 3: Self-contradiction in conclusion
G => H + !H
# Expected: G = true (input), error/contradiction
