# Error Cases Test - Contradictions and Negation Conflicts

# Test 1: Simple contradiction without forcing (B => !B, B not set)
# B => !B (rule says if B then not B - B should remain false)
B => !B
# Expected: B = false

# Test 2: Contradiction through chain
# E => F, F => !E (E triggers F, F contradicts E)
E => F
F => !E
# Expected: E = true (input), F = true, contradiction

# Test 3: Self-contradiction in conclusion
# G => H + !H (G triggers both H and not H)
G => H + !H
# Expected: G = true (input), error/contradiction
