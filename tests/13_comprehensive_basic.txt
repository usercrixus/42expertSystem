# Comprehensive Basic Test - Single Complex Rule
# Tests AND, OR, XOR, Negation, Parentheses, Chaining, Multiple conclusions

# Main complex rule :
( ( A + B ) | ( C ^ D ) ) + !E => F + G
# Expected: F = true, G = true

# Chaining from conclusions and same conclusion
F => H
G => I
H + I => J + F
# Expected: H = true, I = true, J = true

= A B C D
? F G H I J
