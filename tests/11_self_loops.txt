# Self-Loop Test

# Test 1: Self-loop with variable set (true)
A => A
# Expected: A = true

# Test 2: Self-loop without variable false
B => B
# Expected: B = false

# Test 3: Self-loop with negation (variable set)
C => !C
# Expected: C = true (input fact), contradiction or error

# Test 4: Self-loop with negation (variable not set)
D => !D
# Expected: D = false

# Test 5: Multiple self-references
E => E
E => !E
# Expected: E = true (input fact), contradiction or error

# Test 6: Self-loop in chain
F => G
G => G
# Expected: F = true, G = true
