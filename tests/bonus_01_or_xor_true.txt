# Bonus: OR and XOR in Conclusions Tests with result true

# Test 1: OR in conclusion
A => !B
A => B | C
# Expected: B = false, C = true

# Test 2: XOR in conclusion
D => E ^ F
D => !F
# Expected: E = true, F = false

# Test 3: OR in conclusion used by another rule
G => H | I
H => J
I => J
# Expected: H = ambiguous, I = ambiguous, J = true

# Test 4: XOR in conclusion used by another rule
P => R
P => Q ^ R
!Q => S
# Expected: Q = false, R = true, S = true
