# Bonus: Biconditional Rules Tests

# Test 1: Simple biconditional - both true
A <=> C
# Expected: C = true

# Test 2: Simple biconditional - reverse direction
D <=> F
# Expected: D = true

# Test 3: Biconditional with both false
G + H <=> I
# Expected: G = false, H = false, I = false

# Test 4: Complex biconditional with negation
J + !K <=> L
# Expected: J = true, K = false, L = true
