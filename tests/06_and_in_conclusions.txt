# Test 1: Simple AND in conclusion
A => B + C
# Expected: B = true, C = true

# Test 2: AND in conclusion - condition not met
D => E + F
# Expected: E = false, F = false

# Test 3: multiple AND in conclusion
G =>  H + I + J + K
# Expected:  H = true, I = true, J = true, K = given true

# Test 4: AND in conclusion with negation
L => M + !N
# Expected: M = true, N = false
